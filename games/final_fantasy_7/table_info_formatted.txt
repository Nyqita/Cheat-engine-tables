Current table version
|  1.0 -- 2019-06-27 18:18:43 (UTC)
Changelog
|  Version 1.0
|  |  Most aspects of the cheat table support English, French, Spanish, and German
|  |  |  Note: Most text was translated using Google Translate - https://translate.google.co.uk/
|  |  |  This means there will inevitably be many examples of incoherent text in the other languages
|  |  Most cheat scripts and tables are tested and working correctly on all Steam versions that I
|  |  ··· had access to (FF7_EN, FF7_FR, FF7_ES, FF7_DE) and on each PlayStation version running on
|  |  ··· each supported emulator

|  |  The cheat table might be compatible with other versions that are not listed, but I haven't
|  |  ··· tested them. If you intend to try using it with untested versions, then please do not save
|  |  ··· your game after making changes - unless you're sure that nothing was broken
|  Checking feature support
|  |  You can also check how many of the cheats have been implemented for each version of the game
|  |  ··· by doing the following:
|  |  |  Open up the LUA engine window
|  |  |  |  Start at the main Cheat Engine window
|  |  |  |  click 'Memory View'
|  |  |  |  click 'Tools' menu
|  |  |  |  click 'Lua Engine'
|  |  |  Enter the following code into the text entry box without quotations or any extra characters
|  |  |  ··· or symbols
|  |  |  |  compare_versions()
|  |  |  Click the 'Execute' button to the right of the text entry box
|  |  This should list all the supported versions of the game and how many of the features have been
|  |  ··· added thus far
|  |  |  Note: Apologies if it's very confusing. Suffice to say, more 'Unimplemented addresses'
|  |  |  ··· means more features missing
Features - abridged
|  Game version detection
|  |  Upon activating the initialisation script, it will attempt to determine which version of the
|  |  ··· game Cheat Engine is currently attached to
|  |  In the case of a Steam version, it will look at the name of the executable - for example,
|  |  ··· FF7_EN.exe - and load the associated table
|  |  In the case of an emulated version, it will attempt to read the emulator's memory for some
|  |  ··· indication of which disc has been loaded
|  |  |  Note: searching the emulator's memory for identifying information about the currently
|  |  |  ··· loaded disc probably won't work for any untested emulators
|  Multiple language support
|  |  Almost all features of the table support multiple languages (this documentation being one of
|  |  ··· the exceptions)
|  |  |  Note: If you save the cheat table before deactivating the initialisation script, then the
|  |  |  ··· translations of the table might stop working. If you make changes to the table, please
|  |  |  ··· ensure you deactivate the initialisation script before attempting to save
|  Real-time generated tables
|  |  Many of the large tables (such as item inventory) are created upon activating their header
|  |  ··· script, rather than being present as hidden table entries at all times. Upon deactivating
|  |  ··· these header scripts, all child entries are deleted from the table. This should make the
|  |  ··· cheat table generally more responsive, make the file size significantly smaller, and allow
|  |  ··· changes to be made to entire sections more easily. You might notice a small delay between
|  |  ··· activating the cheat entry and the tables being shown, but from my testing this is usually
|  |  ··· less than a second
|  |  |  Note: if you save the cheat table with the header scripts activated, then the file size
|  |  |  ··· will be far larger. If you wish to reduce file size and retain responsiveness, try to
|  |  |  ··· only save the table once all scripts have been deactivated first
|  Memory record custom types
|  |  Menu Item ID
|  |  |  Used for showing the correct ID of inventory items from the main menu (not in-battle items)
|  |  Menu Item Qty
|  |  |  Used for showing the correct quantity of inventory items from the main menu (not in-battle
|  |  |  ··· items)
|  |  3 bytes
|  |  |  Used for showing the correct EXP of materia
Cheat table
|  Cheats
|  |  Inventory
|  |  |  Have all menu items & infinite use
|  |  |  |  Will give you X amount of every item in the game and freeze the quantity to that value
|  |  |  |  ··· until the script is deactivated
|  |  |  |  |  Note: X amount can be changed by editing the script and setting the value of "local
|  |  |  |  |  ··· item_quantity = VALUE" to whatever you prefer (not a number greater than 99)
|  |  |  Have all key items
|  |  |  |  Will give you one of every key item in the game, including the two key items that cannot
|  |  |  |  ··· normally be obtained (Letter to a Daughter and Letter to a Wife)
|  |  |  Have one of every materia and mastered
|  |  |  |  Will give you one of each materia in the game and set their EXP to mastered. Also
|  |  |  |  ··· freezes the last materia inventory slot as empty, allowing you to quickly destroy
|  |  |  |  ··· any unwanted materia by moving them to the final slot
|  |  |  Maximum power starting equipment
|  |  |  |  Sets the weapon stats for every starting weapon (Buster Sword, Leather Glove , Gatling
|  |  |  |  ··· Gun , Mythril Clip , Guard Stick , Spear , 4-point Shuriken , Yellow M-phone ,
|  |  |  |  ··· Quicksilver) to 'perfect' stats
|  |  |  |  |  This includes, but isn't limited to:
|  |  |  |  |  |  Four pairs of linked materia slots, triple materia growth rate, maximum attack
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· value, maximum attack accuracy value (never miss a physical attack)
|  |  |  |  Also sets 'perfect' stats for the Bronze Bangle
|  |  |  |  |  This includes, but isn't limited to:
|  |  |  |  |  |  Four pairs of linked materia slots, triple materia growth rate, maximum defense,
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· and maximum evasion rate (never get hit by a physical attack)
|  |  |  |  Also sets 'perfect' stats for the Power Wrist
|  |  |  |  |  This includes, but isn't limited to:
|  |  |  |  |  |  Absorb all elemental attacks, immune to every status effect except: poison, haste,
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· regen, barrier, mbarrier, reflect, shield
|  |  |  |  |  Note: poison isn't added to the list of immunities because being afflicted by the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· poison status will regenerate your HP
|  |  In battle
|  |  |  Lucky 7s
|  |  |  |  Set every character's current battle HP and maximum battle HP to 7,777 (which triggers
|  |  |  |  ··· the "All 7s Fever!" game mechanic)
|  |  |  |  |  Further reading: https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/All_Lucky_7s
|  |  |  |  |  Note 1: deactivating this will NOT return your characters' current and maximum HP to
|  |  |  |  |  ··· their values before activation. Your maximum HP will remain at 7,777 until the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· end of the encounter
|  |  |  |  |  Note 2: don't activate this at the same time as any other cheat that repeatedly
|  |  |  |  |  ··· changes either your current or maximum HP e.g. "Maximum HP" or "Rest in peace"
|  |  |  Rest in peace
|  |  |  |  Set every character's current battle HP to 1
|  |  |  |  |  Note 1: useful in combination with the "Frequent Random Encounters" cheat if you want
|  |  |  |  |  ··· to quickly get into battle and wipe your party to return to the main menu (for
|  |  |  |  |  ··· versions of the game that don't support a soft reset, such as Steam)
|  |  |  |  |  Note 2: don't activate this at the same time as any other cheat that repeatedly
|  |  |  |  |  ··· changes either your current or maximum HP e.g. "Maximum HP" or "Lucky 7s"
|  |  |  Maximum HP
|  |  |  |  Set every character's current battle HP and maximum battle HP to 9,999
|  |  |  |  |  Note 1: deactivating this will NOT return your characters' current and maximum HP to
|  |  |  |  |  ··· their values before activation. Your maximum HP will remain at 9,999 until the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· end of the encounter
|  |  |  |  |  Note 2: don't activate this at the same time as any other cheat that repeatedly
|  |  |  |  |  ··· changes either your current or maximum HP e.g. "Lucky 7s" or "Rest in peace"
|  |  |  Maximum MP
|  |  |  |  Set every character's current battle MP and maximum battle MP to 999
|  |  |  |  |  Note: deactivating this will NOT return your characters' current and maximum MP to
|  |  |  |  |  ··· their values before activation. Your maximum MP will remain at 999 until the end
|  |  |  |  |  ··· of the encounter
|  |  |  Fast limit breaks
|  |  |  |  Keeps all characters' limit break maters full
|  |  |  |  |  Note: this might not appear to take effect immediately. While the real limit break
|  |  |  |  |  ··· value will be fixed at 255 (full), the displayed limit break meter will take a
|  |  |  |  |  ··· second or so to fill, and the limit break option won't become available on the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· battle command menu until it fills
|  |  |  Full ATB Meter
|  |  |  |  Keeps all characters' ATB meters full
|  |  Random encounters frequency
|  |  |  Instant random encounters (world)
|  |  |  |  Sets the random encounter 'ticker' to a high value such that it should initiate a random
|  |  |  |  ··· encounter after the player has taken one 'step' on the world map
|  |  |  No random encounters (world)
|  |  |  |  When activated: Sets the byte that determines whether world random encounters can occur
|  |  |  |  ··· to 0 (disallowed)
|  |  |  |  When deactivated: Sets the byte that determines whether world random encounters can
|  |  |  |  ··· occur to 1 (allowed)
|  |  |  |  |  Note: deactivation doesn't change the 'ticker' value to its default, so you may enter
|  |  |  |  |  ··· a random encounter merely one step after deactivating this
|  |  |  Instant random encounters (field)
|  |  |  |  Sets the random encounter 'ticker' to a high value such that it should initiate a random
|  |  |  |  ··· encounter after the player has taken one 'step' in a field map
|  |  |  No random encounters (field)
|  |  |  |  When activated: Sets the byte that determines whether world random encounters can occur
|  |  |  |  ··· to 0 (disallowed)
|  |  |  |  When deactivated: Sets the byte that determines whether world random encounters can
|  |  |  |  ··· occur to 1 (allowed)
|  |  |  |  |  Note: deactivation doesn't change the 'ticker' value to its default, so you may enter
|  |  |  |  |  ··· a random encounter merely one step after deactivating this
|  |  Miscellaneous cheats
|  |  |  Save / PHS anywhere
|  |  |  |  Always have the ability to save or use the PHS system from the menu (provided that those
|  |  |  |  ··· menu options have been unlocked)
|  |  |  |  |  Note: entering the PHS screen when you only have access to one or two party members
|  |  |  |  |  ··· will make it impossible to leave the screen, unless you change your current
|  |  |  |  |  ··· roster to include three party members. See Miscellaneous > Current roster for
|  |  |  |  |  ··· those options
|  |  |  Enter debug room (PlayStation only)
|  |  |  |  Forces the next field screen you enter to be the developer's first debug room
|  |  |  |  |  Note 1: this only works on PlayStation versions of the game and the behaviour of the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· debug rooms may change between those versions. You MUST deactivate this in order
|  |  |  |  |  ··· to transition to any other screen than the first debug room. If you keep this
|  |  |  |  |  ··· activated, you will simply keep re-entering the same room with Yuffie and be
|  |  |  |  |  ··· unable to reach any of the other debug rooms
|  |  |  |  |  Note 2: This doesn't work on any Steam versions I've tested, but you may have some
|  |  |  |  |  ··· success
|  |  |  Speed hack
|  |  |  |  Allows the game to run at a higher speed, up to 5 times
|  |  |  |  |  Note: only seems to work intermittently. You're probably better off using the "Enable
|  |  |  |  |  ··· Speedhack" menu in Cheat Engine. This is here as a convenience should you wish to
|  |  |  |  |  ··· assign a hotkey to it
|  |  |  Colour theme settings
|  |  |  |  Allows you to cycle forwards, backwards, or select from a list of premade menu themes.
|  |  |  |  ··· All themes used were taken from the following Imgur album:
|  |  |  |  https://imgur.com/a/sKP6G
|  |  |  |  |  Note: this changes the menu themes in real-time, allowing you to adjust the colours
|  |  |  |  |  ··· during battles and dialogue

|  |  |  |  This shows various timers that appear throughout the game, such as the bomb timer at the

|  |  |  Shows the following stats for all characters
|  |  |  |  Limit break availability
|  |  |  |  |  The amount of limit break meter left over from your last battle
|  |  |  |  |  A value from 0 to 255 (255 means limit break meter full and ready to use)

|  |  |  |  |  ··· be affected by the chosen weapon's stats. If you select a weapon intended for use
|  |  |  |  |  ··· by a different character, the weapon model might be invisible
|  |  |  |  |  |  Note: weapon doesn't have to be acquired in order to be equipped. For example, you
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· could equip Sephiroth's normally unobtainable Masamune
|  |  |  |  Currently equipped armour
|  |  |  |  |  Note: armour doesn't have to be acquired in order to be equipped
|  |  |  |  Currently equipped accessory

|  |  |  |  Total kills

|  |  |  |  Selected limit level
|  |  |  |  |  A value from 1 to 4 indicating which limit break level is currently selected.
|  |  |  |  |  ··· Changing the chosen limit break level from the game menu empties your limit break
|  |  |  |  |  ··· meter. Changing this value does not
|  |  |  |  Times limit break level # used
|  |  |  |  |  The total number of times the character has used a limit break of this level
|  |  |  |  |  |  Note: usually a character acquires the second limit break attack for that level
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· once they have used the first limit break attack 8 times. Changing this value
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· to 8 or higher will make most characters learn the second limit break attack
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· at the next battle results screen
|  |  |  |  Current level
|  |  |  |  |  A value from 0 to 99
|  |  |  |  |  |  Note: this doesn't change your current EXP, so you can temporarily increase this
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· to 99 for some easier fights, then revert it back to the original value
|  |  |  |  |  |  ··· without any permanent effects
|  |  |  |  EXP to next level

|  |  |  Limit break availability
|  |  |  |  The character's current limit break meter level
|  |  |  |  A value from 0 to 255
|  |  |  |  |  Note: this might not be immediately reflected in the displayed limit break meter,
|  |  |  |  |  ··· however it is the 'real' value. The displayed meter will gradually grow towards
|  |  |  |  |  ··· this value, which may take some seconds
|  |  |  Current MP
|  |  |  |  A value from 1 to 999
|  |  |  Maximum MP
|  |  |  |  A value from 1 to 999
|  |  |  |  |  Note: this value won't appear on the battle menu
|  |  |  Current HP
|  |  |  |  A value from 1 to 9,999
|  |  |  Maximum HP
|  |  |  |  A value from 1 to 9,999
|  |  |  |  |  Note: this value won't change the maximum HP value shown on the battle menu, but
|  |  |  |  |  ··· changing this to a higher value will allow your current HP to increase above the
|  |  |  |  |  ··· shown amount
|  |  Accessory attributes

|  |  |  |  |  Note: bytes are in the order Red Green Blue but the game uses Little Endian byte
|  |  |  |  |  ··· order. If you wish to write these values as an array of bytes, simply use a value
|  |  |  |  |  ··· like RR GG BB (where RR = red value; GG = green value; BB = blue value). If you
|  |  |  |  |  ··· wish to write these values as three or four byte values (depending on whether

|  |  |  |  |  ··· writing RRGGBB in Little Endian would become the byte sequence BB GG RR

Known issues
|  French version on Steam (FF7_FR.exe)
|  |  Chocobo stables 5 and 6 have their stats in a different location to the first 4 stables. The
|  |  ··· cheat table doesn't yet implement a fix for this
|  TTreeNodes.GetNodeFromIndex Index Out of Bounds error
|  |  If there is a suitable remedy, I will try to implement it. Until then, you can keep track of
|  |  ··· the bug report at the official Cheat Engine forums
|  |  https://forum.cheatengine.org/viewtopic.php?t=610281
Potential questions
|  Why have you put all the LUA code in the enable section of the initialisation script, rather than
|  ··· in the autorun portion of the script, or in an automatic script when the cheat table is
|  ··· loaded?
|  |  I feel more comfortable knowing that nothing in the table will run without the user first
|  |  ··· having a chance to look through all the code first. I'm sure most people won't take much
|  |  ··· interest, but for those who want to look through to check there's nothing potentially
|  |  ··· malicious, they're able to do so before their first use
|  |  Also, I assume it will make things much more convenient for people who wish to copy and paste
|  |  ··· the whole table into another cheat table of their own - should they wish to use some of
|  |  ··· the features of mine along with theirs
|  Will the table have full support for Japanese versions of the game, including having the cheat
|  ··· table itself translated to Japanese?
|  |  The table is compatible with the PlayStation 1 International Japanese version, but I doubt
|  |  ··· that I'll be able to implement full language support for it. For now, it defaults to
|  |  ··· displaying the whole table in English (including using the English names for all items,
|  |  ··· weapons, etc.). From what I've read, the Japanese version of the game uses significantly
|  |  ··· different text encoding, and it would be far more complicated to support Japanese than for
|  |  ··· languages that use the Latin alphabet
|  |  For further reading, please consult the qhimm.com wiki article on text encoding:
|  |  http://web.archive.org/web/20161006234528/http://wiki.qhimm.com/view/FF7/Text_encoding
Final notes
|  During the minification process, the comments made in the LUA scripts have been removed. These
|  ··· comments provided links to references and source materials for all the code I used that was
|  ··· written by someone else, or a resource I used that helped me to understand some aspects of
|  ··· the game. The unminified versions can be found on the GitHub or GitLab pages mentioned in the
|  ··· Authors section, near the beginning of the document
|  If you visit those pages, you can find the URLs to the sources or reference materials in the
|  ··· various code comments (typically just after the function declaration). I also referenced
|  ··· various threads on the qhimm.com forums and wiki that were very helpful in understanding some
|  ··· of the game mechanics (especially chocobo stats)
|  I'm not sure if anyone will end up using this cheat table, but I've put quite a lot of time and
|  ··· effort into its creation. If you wish to copy any parts of this and share them with others,
|  ··· please try to keep the links to the various sources and reference materials intact, as well
|  ··· as not removing any authors from the documentation. If you make any significant changes, then
|  ··· please consider adding yourself to the Authors section
|  Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope you find this helpful, and that you're looking
|  ··· forward to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake as much as I am :)
